# Building and installing hipDF from source

For developers, the following topic walks you through all necessary steps for building hipDF from source files.
For your convenience, the steps for the full installation including python enablement are condensed
into the [install_hipdf.sh](https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipDF/blob/release/2.0.x/install_hipdf.sh) script. Read and edit the
script carefully to adapt the environment variables for your installation.

The following provides details on building the C++ components, running tests and benchmarks, and for building 
the full hipDF installation including the Python layer. End users should see the [Installation instructions](./INSTALL.md).

## Build procedure for the C++ components

Building the C++/HIP components of hipDF can be achieved via the following command:

```bash
./build.sh libcudf tests benchmarks
```

Here, `tests` and `benchmarks` are optional flags that enable the respective additional functionalities. 

```{note}
In order to fetch the dependencies `git` needs to be installed on your system.
```

## Running tests and benchmarks

To run the tests use:

```bash
ctest --test-dir cpp/build/
```

To run the benchmarks use:

```bash
find cpp/build/benchmarks/ -type f -executable -exec {} \;
```

## Building and installing hipDF including the Python layer

You will perform the following steps:

1. [Install Conda](#step-1-install-conda)
2. [Download the hipDF repository](#step-2-clone-the-hipdf-repository)
3. [Create and activate hipDF Conda environment `hipdf_dev`](#step-3-create-and-activate-hipdf-conda-environment-hipdf_dev)
4. [Install the CuPy wheel into `hipdf_dev`](#step-4-install-cupy-into-hipdf_dev)
5. [Install Numba HIP into `hipdf_dev`](#step-5-install-numba-hip-into-hipdf_dev)
6. [Install hipMM into `hipdf_dev`](#step-6-install-hipmm-into-hipdf_dev)
7. [Install hipDF into `hipdf_dev`](#step-7-install-hipdf-into-hipdf_dev)
8. [Verify correctness of installation](#step-8-verify-correct-installation)

### Step 1: Install Conda

hipDF must be built inside of a predefined Conda environment to ensure that
it is working properly. While the hipDF build process fetches C++
dependencies itself, it has Cython and Python dependencies (CuPy, Numba HIP,
hipMM, HIP Python, ROCm LLVM Python) that need to be installed into the
hipDF Conda environment before you can build and run the package. The
following diagram gives an overview:

![hipDF Cython (build) and Python (runtime) dependencies.](../data/install/hipdf_cypy_deps.svg)

On an x86 Linux machine it is possible to download and install Miniforge with the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

For other architectures and operating systems take a look at the webpage of [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/).

### Step 2: Clone the hipDF repository

Create a work directory `/tmp/hipdf` and clone the hipDF release branch into this directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/hipdf # NOTE: feel free to adapt
cd /tmp/hipdf

git clone -b release/rocmds-25.10 https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipDF hipdf
```

### Step 3: Create and activate hipDF Conda environment hipdf_dev.

Create and activate the `hipdf_dev` Conda environment via:

```bash
cd /tmp/hipdf/hipdf

conda env create --name hipdf_dev --file conda/environments/all_rocm_arch-x86_64.yaml
conda activate hipdf_dev
```

### Step 4: Install CuPy into hipdf_dev

#### Via AMD PyPI (recommended)

```bash
conda activate hipdf_dev
pip install amd-cupy~=13.5.1 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.amd.com/simple
```

#### From source

These instructions use the AMD MI300 GPU (gfx942 architecture). The following only serves
as an example. ``HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET`` can be set to [any supported architecture ](./hipDF-support.rst).

1. In order to build CuPy from source, you will not only require the library
   packages (`hipblas`, `hipfft`, ...) but also additional development packages
   (`-dev` suffix on Ubuntu). Please ensure they are installed.

   Typical install command (may require super user privileges):

   ```bash
   apt-get update

   apt install -y rocthrust-dev hipcub hipblas \
                  hipblas-dev hipfft hipsparse \
                  hiprand rocsolver rocrand-dev
   ```

   ```{note}
   Some ROCm installations may require that you append the ROCm version
   as suffix to the package names (example: `hipblas-dev7.0.0`). You can
   understand what to do via the `rocm-core` package, which will be installed
   for any ROCm installation. Check if the installed `rocm-core` package has
   the ROCm version as suffix via `apt list`, then install the CuPy build
   dependencies accordingly.
   ```

2. Clone the CuPy release branch into the work directory:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp/hipdf
   git clone -b release/rocmds-25.10 https://github.com/ROCm/cupy cupy
   ```

3. Build and install the CuPy wheel:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp/hipdf
   git submodule update --init
   conda activate hipdf_dev
   python3 -m pip install build scipy
   export CUPY_INSTALL_USE_HIP=1
   export ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm        # NOTE: adapt to your environment
   export HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET="gfx942" # NOTE: set AMD GPU architecture(s)
   SETUPTOOLS_BUILD_PARALLEL=${MAX_JOBS:-1} python3 -m build --wheel
   CUPY_WHEEL=$(find ~+ -type f -name "*cupy*.whl")
   pip install ${CUPY_WHEEL}
   ```

You can specify the AMD GPU architectures via the `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET`
environment variable (add a separator if needed: `,`) as shown.
Refer to [Release Compatibility](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocm-ds-internal/en/latest/about/compatibility-matrix.html)
for supported GPU architectures.

### Step 5: Install Numba HIP into hipdf_dev.

Provide the version of your ROCm installation here via the
optional dependency key `rocm-X-Y-Z`, as shown in the following command.

```bash
conda activate hipdf_dev

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.amd.com/simple \
  numba-hip[rocm-7-0-2]@git+https://github.com/rocm/numba-hip.git
  # NOTE: adapt ROCm key to your Python version
```

### Step 6: Install hipMM into hipdf_dev

#### Via AMD PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install amd-hipmm==3.0.0 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.amd.com/simple
```

#### From source

The following instructions use the AMD MI300 GPU (gfx942 architecture). However, this
is only for example purposes. ``RAPIDS_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES`` can be
set to [any supported architecture ](./hipDF-support.rst).

1. Clone the hipMM release branch into the work directory:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp/hipdf
   git clone -b release/rocmds-25.10 https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipMM hipmm
   ```

2. Build and install the hipMM wheel:

   ```bash
   conda activate hipdf_dev

   cd /tmp/hipdf/hipmm
   export RAPIDS_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx942" # NOTE: set AMD GPU architecture(s)
   export CXX="hipcc"  # Cython CXX compiler, adapt to your environment
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}:/opt/rocm/lib/cmake" # NOTE: ROCm CMake package location, adapt to your environment

   ./build.sh librmm rmm # Build rmm and install into `hipdf_dev` conda env.
   ```

You can set the AMD GPU architecture(s) to build for via the
`RAPIDS_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` environment variable (separator: `;`), or rely on auto detection.

### Step 7: Install hipDF into hipdf_dev

These instructions use the AMD MI300 GPU (gfx942 architecture). However, this
is only for example purposes. ``CUDF_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES`` can be set
to [any supported architecture ](./hipDF-support.rst).

Install the `amd-hipdf` Python package as shown below:

```bash
conda activate hipdf_dev

cd /tmp/hipdf/hipdf
export CXX="hipcc"  # Cython CXX compiler, adapt to your environment
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}:/opt/rocm/lib/cmake

export PARALLEL_LEVEL=16 # NOTE: number of build threads, adapt as needed

export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O2 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--disable-new-dtags -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined -Wl,-rpath,/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -Wl,-rpath,${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib -Wl,-rpath-link,${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib -L${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib"

export CUDF_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx942" # NOTE: adapt to your AMD GPU architecture

bash build.sh libcudf pylibcudf cudf # NOTE: the build target is called 'cudf'
```

You can set the AMD GPU architecture(s) to build for via the
`CUDF_CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` environment variable (separator: `;`), or rely on auto detection.

### Step 8: Verify correct installation

To verify that hipDF was installed correctly, see [Verifying your hipDF Installation](VERIFY.md).
