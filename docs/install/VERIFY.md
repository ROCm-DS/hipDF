# Verifying your hipDF Installation

```{important}
* Running the instructions in this section requires an AMD GPU in your system.
* hipDF relies on CuPy with the ROCm backend. You must set the `ROCM_HOME` environment variable to the root of your ROCm installation so CuPy can locate ROCm. If ROCm is installed in the default location, set: `export ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm`
* The instructions assume a Conda environment named `hipdf`. If your environment has a different name, replace `hipdf` in the commands with the environment name.
```

After installing hipDF for use in the Conda environment `hipdf`, you can
verify the correctness of the installation as follows:

```bash
conda activate hipdf
python3
```

Then enter the following code commands:

```python3
import hipdf
print(hipdf.__version__)
```

You should see output that is similar to:

```text
Python 3.12.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun  4 2025, 14:45:31) [GCC 13.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import hipdf
>>> print(hipdf.__version__)
2.0.00
```
