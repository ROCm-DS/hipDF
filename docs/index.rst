********************************************************************
hipDF documentation
********************************************************************

hipDF enables GPU-accelerated DataFrames based on the Apache Arrow columnar memory
format. Its API is similar to that of Pandas, letting you accelerate both your existing and new
data science workloads on AMD GPUs with high-level functions that eliminate the
need to go into low-level HIP programming. This library enables large-scale data processing on AMD Instinct
GPUs, enabling data manipulation tasks such as loading, joining, aggregating, and filtering
to be performed on data in GPU memory. hipDF offers both a Python and C++ API, supporting
a wide range of use cases. For more information and to learn about what's new in the latest release, see :ref:`what-is-hipdf`

The hipDF code is open and hosted at `https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipDF <https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipDF>`_.
