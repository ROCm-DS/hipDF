********************************************************************
What is hipDF?
********************************************************************

In addition to containing the necessary tools to build powerful new data processing applications,
hipDF enables you to easily port your existing Pandas and cuDF workloads to AMD GPUs. hipDF
is aligned with and is API-compatible with RAPIDS® cuDF 25.02, allowing for workloads to be
transitioned to AMD devices without hipification. 

hipDF v2.0.0 includes the following features: 

* hipDF offers the Series and DataFrame data structures for storing and manipulating data
  directly on the GPU. The Series data structure acts as a one-dimensional array, while the DataFrame
  acts as a two-dimensional array with rows and columns. These data structures are similar to those
  in the widely used Pandas library and include similar methods to their Pandas counterparts allowing you
  to perform basic operations on the data structures and data within. 

* In addition to the data structure methods, more functionality is included to analyze and manipulate the
  DataFrames and data within them. This functionality includes: 

  - Group data and perform additional operations on data within the groups. 
  - Perform statistical operations on windows within the data. 
  - Perform comparative operations on and within data structures. 
  - Concatenate, merge, cut, and otherwise manipulate the data structures to better work on or analyze the data. 
  - Run Sub-word Tokenizers on the data to prepare it for your large language models. 
  - Perform a variety of commonly used string-handling operations on text data. 
  - Use well-known and commonly used list operations to process and extract information from the data structures. 

* hipDF supports a wide range of input and output file formats, allowing you to read data from various
  sources and save data to your preferred format. The supported formats include CSV, Text, JSON, Parquet, ORC, HDF5,
  Feather, and Avro.
