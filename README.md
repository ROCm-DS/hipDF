follow the latter's directory structure and API naming as closely as possible to minimize porting friction for users that are interested in using both projects.

## Overview

Built based on the [Apache Arrow](http://arrow.apache.org/) columnar memory format, hipDF is a GPU DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data.

hipDF provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers & data scientists, so they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows without going into the details of HIP programming.

For example, the following snippet downloads a CSV, then uses the GPU to parse it into rows and columns and run calculations:
```python
import cudf

tips_df = cudf.read_csv("https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/tips.csv")
tips_df["tip_percentage"] = tips_df["tip"] / tips_df["total_bill"] * 100

# display average tip by dining party size
print(tips_df.groupby("size").tip_percentage.mean())
```

Or, you can use hipDF as a no-code-change accelerator for pandas, using
[`cudf.pandas`](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/cudf_pandas).
`cudf.pandas` supports 100% of the pandas API, utilizing hipDF for
supported operations and falling back to pandas when needed:

```python
%load_ext cudf.pandas  # pandas operations now use the GPU!

import pandas as pd

tips_df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/tips.csv")
tips_df["tip_percentage"] = tips_df["tip"] / tips_df["total_bill"] * 100

# display average tip by dining party size
print(tips_df.groupby("size").tip_percentage.mean())
```

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, a docker image is not available for AMD GPUs.

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Incompatibility notice: Mixing RAPIDS and ROCmDS packages/installations is not supported. To avoid conflicts, strictly separate and isolated environments must be maintained if it is required to install both RAPIDS and ROCm-DS packages on the same system.

> [!NOTE]
> We support only AMD GPUs. Use the RAPIDS package for NVIDIA GPUs.

### ROCm/GPU Requirements

* ROCm HIP SDK compilers version 6.4+
* Build requirements: `rocthrust-dev`, `rocm-llvm-dev`, `hipcub` (Ubuntu)
* Runtime requirements: `rocm-llvm-dev` (Ubuntu)
* Officially supported architecture (gfx90a, gfx942).
* Ubuntu 22.04+

<!-- ### CUDA/GPU requirements

* CUDA 11.2+
* NVIDIA driver 450.80.02+
* Volta architecture or better (Compute Capability >=7.0)

### Pip

cuDF can be installed via `pip` from the NVIDIA Python Package Index.
Be sure to select the appropriate cuDF package depending
on the major version of CUDA available in your environment:

For CUDA 11.x:

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com cudf-cu11
```

For CUDA 12.x:

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com cudf-cu12
```

### Conda

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this option is not supported for AMD GPUs.

hipDF can be installed with conda (via [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or the full [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download)) from the `rapidsai` channel:

```bash
# NOTE: Conda installation not supported for hipDF for AMD GPUs.
conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia \
    cudf=25.02 python=3.12 cuda-version=12.8
```

We also provide [nightly Conda packages](https://anaconda.org/rapidsai-nightly) built from the HEAD
of the latest cuDF development branch.

> [!NOTE]
> hipDF is supported only on Linux, and with Python versions 3.9 and later.

See the [RAPIDS installation guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install) for more OS and version info. -->

## Build/Install from Source
See build [instructions](INSTALL.md).


## Open GPU Data Science

The ROCm-DS suite of open source software libraries aims to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on AMD GPUs. It relies on ROCm HIP primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.


### Apache Arrow on GPU

The GPU version of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a common API that enables efficient interchange of tabular data between processes running on the GPU. End-to-end computation on the GPU avoids unnecessary copying and converting of data off the GPU, reducing compute time and cost for high-performance analytics common in artificial intelligence workloads. As the name implies, hipDF uses the Apache Arrow columnar data format on the GPU. Currently, a subset of the features in Apache Arrow are supported.
