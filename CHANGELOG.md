# Changelog for hipDF

Documentation for hipDF is available at
[https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipDF/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipDF/en/latest/).

## hipDF 2.0.0 for ROCm-DS 25.10

### Added

 * Major upgrade aligning hipDF APIs with RAPIDS cuDF 25.02 APIs.

### Known limitations and notes
 * DEBUG builds with -O0 optimization are not currently supported. Use -Og or higher for DEBUG builds (default setting). Support for -O0 is planned in a future toolchain update.
 * When using the cudf.pandas acceleration layer with XNACK enabled and workloads that significantly exceed physical GPU VRAM (oversubscription), some systems may exhibit instability or reduced performance under heavy memory pressure. 
 * Using the cudf.pandas acceleration layer with XNACK disabled (`HSA_XNACK=0`) can trigger instabilities.

## hipDF 1.0.0b1 for ROCm-DS 25.05

### Added

* Initial release based on cuDF 23.10.
