// NOTE(HIP/AMD): This test is intended to fail:
// It is testing how the system handles CUDA-related fatal errors 
// when working with column vectors in cuDF. It creates a ColumnVector,
// and later, it tries converting the vector to long integers (asLongs()), 
// which could trigger CUDA operations.
// Class BadDeviceBuffer represents a defective device buffer;
// it causes CUDA fatal error by operating on a bad device buffer.
// In essence, it is similar to libcudf error_handling_test:
// (cudf-rocm/cpp/tests/error/error_handling_test.cu).
// On CUDA, an exception is raised which is handled later in the test.
// On HIP side, unlike CUDA, execution is not continued after the error on the device.
